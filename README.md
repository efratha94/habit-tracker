A habit tracker, built with React, NodeJS and MongoDB.
It's hosted on heroku so you can check it out here: https://efratha94-habit-tracker.herokuapp.com/

After you add a habit to track, you can click on the date and mark it as completed.

TBD:
    - [] Hiding passwords (12345 --> *****)
    - [] Password hashing (at the moment it's not implemented, so I can see your passwords. Choose wisely)
    - [] Redirecting to Sign In page upon registration error message that user already exists
    - [] Cookies and sessions (You'll be logged out upon refresh)
    - [] Choosing dates and calendar view 
    - [] Displaying graphs and data for each habit
