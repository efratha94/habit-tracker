A habit tracker, built with React, NodeJS and MongoDB.
It's hosted on heroku so you can check it out here: https://efratha94-habit-tracker.herokuapp.com/

After you add a habit to track, you can click on the date and mark it as completed.

TBD:
 - [ ] Password hashing (at the moment it's not implemented, so I can see your passwords. Choose wisely)
 - [ ] Better errors from DB (adding a switch statement for common errors and showing readable errors instead of errors as they're received from db)
 - [ ] Redirecting to Sign In page upon registration error message that user already exists
 - [ ] Cookies and sessions (You'll be logged out upon refresh)
 - [ ] Choosing dates and calendar view 
 - [ ] Displaying graphs and data for each habit
 - [ ] Making app styling responsive
